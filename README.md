Live version of the app is found at https://aspen-9dda6.web.app/

This is Aspen, a webpage for people to share photos of the trees they love.  As a lover of trees and developer, I wanted to created a 
site that would let people post "arborial content" in a unique environment hopefully free from the typical issues that come with 
more popular and generalized forms of social media.  The site is made with the idea of creating a platform that uniquely emphasizes the
tree over the person posting, and promotes discussion aimed more at educating and identifying species accurately than entertainment.

The website was created/prototyped using Firebase, as it allowed me to focus on the creation of the site's front end while still having a
viable product running in a live environment online.  It also lets me have a clearer picture of the architecture needed back-end before
committing to any specific construction.  The final product will (tentatively) be a Postgres database written in Express.

As of right now the project is a bare bones, minimally viable product that:

* Allows anyone to create a user name and password with a given email address
* Lets a user log in and log out
* Lets a user post an image with comments

Future additions include:

* Massive design overhaul
* Desktop version (best if viewed on mobile as of now)
* Email authentication upon registration.
* The ability to "like" a post by using a variety of different tree-related reaction icons (i.e. an acorn, pine cone, fall leaf, flower etc.)
* A "hot" algorithm using said likes to give a subreddit-style trending feed.
* The ability to include species info with the ability for the user ask for help or to convey their confidence in identifying a species.

Although the web site is live right now, it is not ready for wide usage and I ask anyone visiting it to keep this in mind.  Any questions are
more than welcome though, and can be directed to Jason Oliver at baaaaark@gmail.com

Happy tree-hugging, and have a great day!
